TODO: bar chart of eigenvalues/moving average spike event pattern at given time t
TODO: movie of ^that for t in t_values

TODO: PCA >> plot first eigenvector as bar graph using mean spike times, where mean is taken over all spikes event patterns that are:
1) in the whole trial
2) in each line cluster from UMAP

TODO: Ask mike if he knows of any Hi-C mapping on the whole marmoset/primate neural transcripome \.
